# Brightness and Power Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between color intensity (RGB values), brightness levels, and power consumption.
It explores how factors such as ambient light and temperature influence automatic brightness control systems used in display devices.

## Objectives
- Study brightness variation across different RGB color values.
- Analyze how ambient light and temperature affect brightness adjustment.
- Estimate power consumption changes with varying brightness.
- Visualize color patterns, power usage, and efficiency insights.

## Key Features
- 100 RGB color samples with ambient and temperature data.
- Automatic brightness adjustment calculations.
- Power and energy efficiency estimation.
- Clean, sortable, and filterable dataset ready for visualization.

## Visual Insights
You can create visualizations such as:
- Bar chart showing brightness vs power.
- Scatter plot comparing ambient light with brightness.
- Conditional formatting or sparklines to show trends directly in the sheet.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and processing
- Logical formula creation
- Data visualization and trend analysis
- Analytical reasoning for energy optimization
